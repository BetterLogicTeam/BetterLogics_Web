                        <li>
                            <div className="icon1245"><img className="" data-src="lending.svg" src="lending.svg" /></div>
                            <a href="#">Borrowing and Lending</a>
                            <p>Peer to peer borrowing and lending application is the most preferred one in the DeFi market. This is because, DeFi makes the process much simpler, quicker and easier by allowing users to avail a loan without a bank account. In some cases, the borrower does not even have to find a lender. Instead, the smart contract itself acts as the lender and calculates the interest rate based on the supply and demand. Some DeFi applications allow users to borrow loans with a fixed interest rate. The whole process gets done in a timely, and efficient manner with the help of DeFi. </p>

                            <p>DeFi is considered as a potential and profitable tool for the gaming industry as it is a platform that helps build decentralized transaction systems, reliable payment networks, and allows users to verify the rarity of their virtual items. The developers of the game can also earn boosted ROI with the help of DeFi and blockchain brings in added benefits such as transparency and decentralization which helps the users set their own rules for the game. </p>

                            <a href="#">Tokenization</a>
                            <p>Tokenization is the process of converting a real-world asset into digital tokens that are issued and managed on a blockchain network and ensures end-to-end secure, quick transactions. DeFi based tokens enable various economic possibilities. </p>

                            <a href="#">Stablecoins</a>
                            <p>A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to real-world assets such as fiat money, gold, and also other cryptocurrencies. The main attribute of stablecoins is that they help tackle price volatility. Combined with DeFi, stablecoins can be used efficiently for various purposes such as lending, borrowing, remittance payments etc.</p>

                            <p>DeFi makes you the sole owner and custodian of your own cryptocurrency assets. With DeFi applications, you can efficiently and securely transfer your cryptos and store them in the wallets encrypted with passwords, and encrypted private keys that you can easily access anytime you want. </p>

                            <a href="#">Decentralized Exchanges</a>
                            <p>DeFi enhances the operations of a decentralized exchange or (DEX) and makes the whole process more efficient and secure. Decentralized exchanges are exchanges that enable direct peer-to-peer transactions between users without involving a central authority. With DeFi, the chances of risks, theft, or price manipulation are completely eliminated and users are ensured a seamless business experience. </p>
                        </li>

                            <a href="#">Identity Management</a>
                            <p>DeFi helps users access a global economic system as DeFi protocols are paired with identity systems based on blockchain technology. DeFi reduces the need for collateralization. It also provides enhanced data privacy and provides open access to customers,  which means anyone from anywhere around the world can efficiently access DeFi applications with just an internet connection.</p>
