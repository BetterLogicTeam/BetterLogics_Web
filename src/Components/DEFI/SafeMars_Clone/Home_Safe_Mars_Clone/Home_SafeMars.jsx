The working of the SafeMars protocol depends on the tax reduction from the transaction fees. It deducts 4% as tax from the transaction fee, in which 2% is directly sent to the token holders and the other 2% is added to an automated liquidity pool. SafeMars exists within a unique domain of tokens, where the investors are rewarded with profits by just holding the token in the digital wallet. These rewards are entirely based on the success rate of the transactions that take place.  </p>

The functioning of this clone platform is very similar to the original SafeMars platform. The SafeMars clone is similar to the original, it provides high yielding and liquidity to the crypto tokens that are built on the Binance Smart Chain platform. The primary working of the SafeMars clone is dependent on their smart contracts. These SafeMars clone smart contracts implement a certain level of funds, represented as processing fees. This processing fee can be represented as the transaction fees that are deducted during the selling and buying process. Due to this implementation, the token holders receive passive revenues. This working method is said to reduce the possibilities of monetary losses due to token holding.</p>
