At the time when the real potential Non Fungible token is being released by everyone, NFT has its own massive market. Likewise, NFT in the game industry completely redefined the mission and destiny of those gaming industries.</p>

                                            <p className="mt-10">As said above, the gaming industry is one of the most centralized and multi-profitable businesses in the entire digital platform. The game assets have no use outside of the game. After the story progress of some games, they have no use, and the assets the user had will also have no value. Sometimes the gaming industry has given the idea for very high-end technologies, and at some point, they acted as a sandbox to bring in various new techniques and ideas. But everything was limited, and a central authority or central node will always keep on controlling and maintaining logs. But When NFT made a debut in the gaming industry, things were structurally changed; NFT replaced the centralized authority with the decentralized structure.



                                            </p>
                                            <p className="mt-10">The adoption of blockchain via NFT into gaming made the industry create various opportunities for gamers. The NFT gaming gave the opportunity to the users to use the assets in the space in various NFT marketplaces outside the game. NFT tokenizes the asset and gives the gamers a revenue model. NFT in the gaming industry paved the way for making NFT gaming marketplaces-that has the potential and audience to reach beyond the existing marketplaces achieved.
