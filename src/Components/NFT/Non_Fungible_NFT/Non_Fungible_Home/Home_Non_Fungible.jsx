NFT will act as a proof of authenticity  for digital assets. A digital ledger known as blockchain will take entry of all the actions happening in the platform. The NFT holder can only own them. All the others are not considered as  original.</p>

Every digitally created content can be converted into NFT, like Pictures, videos, pieces of music and more. Once they are converted into NFTs, they will have unique
                                    Value. The Blockchain, which powers NFTs, will store all the data in the decentralized method, Which makes the information canâ€™t be traced back to the Owner.</p>
